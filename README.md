# LEFO R tutorials

## What is this?
A series of tutorials, mostly using R, that members of the [Plant Functional Ecology Laboratory (LEFO)](https://lefo.ca) put together. The tutorials cover various data processing and analysis tasks that we commonly do.

## English... and French?
Université de Montréal (UdeM), where our lab is based, is a french-speaking institution. As such some of tutorials are in French. It depends who wrote it and for what purpose. Tutorials that were initially designed around teaching a UdeM course will be in French.

## Type of tutorials
The tutorials are about data science and are split into three different categories of data-related activities:

1. **acquisition**: either from the internet or from instruments
2. **processing**: common data wrangling operations
3. **analysis**: fitting models
4. **visualization**: graphs, maps, etc

## How to find the tutorials
First go to the folder corresponding to the data operation of interest. Then, sub-folders will relate to different themes or data types. Finally, every single tutorial should be in a separate folder with a short name that should allow you to find it.

> The tutorials can be found by clicking on the `.md` (Markdown) files. They will render as HTML files that can be read in your browser.

The structure of this repo is to make it as easy as possible for lab members to contribute tutorials. The drawback is that's it's not as easy to find the tutorials, as it would if it was a structured website. Perhaps in the future we will make such a website. Perhaps not.

## How to contribute
1. [Clone the repo](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) on RStudio
2. Always pull before you start
3. Create a folder for your tutorial at the right place
4. Make sure it's a [Github document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html)
5. Add any files / folders too large for Github to the `.gitignore` file
6. Commit the changes
7. Push to GitHub
