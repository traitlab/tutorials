# LEFO R tutorials

## What is this?
A series of tutorials, mostly using R, that members of the [Plant Functional Ecology Laboratory (LEFO)](www.lefo.ca) put together. The tutorials cover various data processing and analysis tasks that we commonly do.

## Type of tutorials
The tutorials are about data science and are split into three different categories of data-related activities:

1. **acquisition**: either from the internet or from instruments
2. **processing**: common data wrangling operations
3. **analysis**: fitting models
4. **visualiztion**: graphs, maps, etc

## How to find the tutorials
First go to the folder corresponding to the data operation of interest. Then, sub-folders will relate to different themes or data types. Finally, every single tutorial should be in a separate folder with a short name that should allow you to find it.

The structure of this repo is to make it as easy as possible for us to contribute tutorials. The drawback is that's it's not as nice as a structured book.

## How to contribute

1. [Clone the repo](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) on RStudio
2. Always pull before you start
3. Create a folder for your tutorial at the right place
4. Make sure it's a [Github document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html)
5. Add any files / folders too large for Github to the `.gitignore` file
6. Commit the changes
7. Push to GitHub

Refer to this book if you need help with the [Github - RStudio integration](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html).
